# fract_ol

The programme can project the following 3 fractals onto the screen: the mandelbrot set, the julia set and the burning ship.

# how it works

To project a fractal, run the programme, and enter either 'mandelbrot, julia, or 'burning_ship' into the command line.  This will display each fractal respectively.
Each fractal uses a different function to test sets for divergence. The pixel colour is set according to whether the set is convergent or divergent.
